                        Lumbini where Prince Siddartha was born is situated in India, which was earlier known as Dambadiva.
                        It was a little pastoral village nestling in this mountain frontier of Nepal in the 6th century BC.

                        Right throughout the year in Sri Lanka there is an exodus of pilgrims on pilgrimage to Dambadiva, where the hallowed sites connected
                        with the life and times of Siddharta Gautama before and after His Supreme Enlightenment are found.
                        However, Punchi Dambadiva (Rathganga Asu Maha Shrawaka Pasvisu Rajamaha Viharaya) is located along the Colombo – Ratnapura – Pelmadulla – 
                        Embilipitiya main highway – near Nonagama Junction off the 22nd km post from Ratnapura. From there lies its turn off along a mountain 
                        winding metalled narrow road running to about 12 km.
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This Punchi Dambadiva reposes itself in the lap of the Sabaragamuwa Province, where in the hazy distance loom the holy mountain profiles of 
                        Sri Pada (Adam’s Peak), the holiest peak of all the peaks in our fair isle.

                        The verdant valleys are saddled copiously with carpets of tea, rubber, cocoa, and coffee gardens, interlaced with lush jungle, and terraced 
                        rice fields set against the backdrop of wooded hills, where whispering rills, cascade down falling into boisterous rock pools.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br> </br>
            <p align="justify">
                Amidst such awe-inspiring mountain capes, there comes into view this fascinating Punchi Dambadiva peeping out of a hillock harbouring a sprawling 
                complex of lofty mansions filling the spread-out landscapes far and wide. It is fascinatingly skirted by the meandering Rath Ganga flowing lazily by.

                Ven. Girimale Chandraloka Thera is the dynamic Viharadhipathi – Founder of this temple named Rathganga Asu Maha Shrawaka Pas Visu Rajamaha Viharaya.

                He is a pleasant and devout thera. He welcomed us and most willingly spent half a day with us in the commodious reception parlour standing on 
                monolithic pillars elaborately carved with alluring cultural motifs and furnished with elegant decor which has turned into a cynosure to any pilgrim.

                Adjoining it are the enormous living rooms for the comfort of the devotees for their lodgings replete with well-equipped shining assortments of 
                furniture and other fittings of every description. Every day pilgrims are provided with meals.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
                Inside the cave chamber, there is a small pond with fish, it’s called Manduka Vila. Water constantly drips from the cave ceiling.
                Because this doesn't stop even in dry periods, pilgrims consider it evidence of the miraculous powers of this holy place.
                The most striking architectural adornment is a Makara-Thorana, which has been restored with the help of local residents after decay and
                destruction. This gateway is unusual due to its size and slight asymmetry. Like the reclining Buddha and the remnants of wall paintings
                in the interior behind it, this gateway is often dated to the Polonnaruwa period, to connect it with the pilgrimage of King Nissanka
                Malla of Polonnaruwa. However, it is more likely a work of the Kandy era.

                In the rear cave chamber, which is also brightly restored, one can see a representation of a Hindu god, namely Vishnu. He is recognizable
                by the blue colour. Vishnu has always been one of the four highest deities in Sri Lankan Buddhism, whereas Shiva has almost no significance
                for Sinhalese Buddhists. Vishnu is considered a great benefactor. Many present-day Sinhalese believe that through his help for humans he
                accumulates good karma, allowing him to become a future Buddha in his next rebirth. However, this does not entirely correspond with the
                traditional notion that the future Buddha is Maitreya, who currently resides in the Tushita Heaven in his penultimate rebirth.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The Viharadhipathi spelled out to me the origin and the concept of this Punchi Dambadiva Temple Complex.

                His most revered ambition in creating it was to have those very sacred pilgrim sites found in ancient Dambadiva, reminiscent of the Buddha, 
                to be exactly molded in their entirety at this Punchi Dambadiva itself. His other wish was to provide an alternative to the people who have 
                financial difficulties to go to India on pilgrimage.

                In order to fulfill this void, his other intent was to create those very replicas of such places as Buddha Gaya, Lumbini, Kusinara, and 
                Jethawanaya, at this Punchi Dambadiva. With a twinkle in his graceful eye, in high glee, the thera averred that he had been successful in 
                fulfilling it by the ‘Grace of the Triple Gem.’

                To achieve his sacred goal, with a determined effort fortified with the unstinted cooperation that he had received from his loyal dayakas, 
                villagers around, and still other well-wishers from outstations as well, he strode ahead with confidence.


                A devout Buddhist Mr. Perera of Panadura rose to the occasion and gave the financial assistance to construct a suitable dwelling to enable the 
                Viharadhipathi to stay in it and carry out this mission. Thereafter, came the promising and great Day for him and his dayakas on 14.4.1981.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                On this paramount day at the auspicious time of 21.17 pm, he moved in with all smiles and contentment into this mud-walled hut clad 
                with tiles that was graciously donated by this good samaritan Mr. Perera, in the company of his Dayakayas, and a host of other well-wishers.

                Languishing in this shanty-like hut under great privation, albeit his daily alms were provided to him by his dayakas, he geared himself 
                to make this ambitious mission a reality.

                With the generous but steady flow of cash donations doled out by his dayakas, villagers, and other pilgrims, he was gloriously successful 
                in the construction of the very first such palatial edifice called the Dharmasala Mandira for which the foundation stone was laid on 3.6.1982. 
                When in no time, it was fully completed.


                As time grew by, he still strived indefatigably to bring this Punchi Damabadiva into a plurality of buildings modeled out on the very such 
                Buddhist sites found in Dambadiva like Buddhagaya, Jethawanarama, Kusinara, Lumbini, and the like.

                The first Buddhist Convention during the Buddha’s lifetime was held at Jethawanaramaya in Dambadiva in a conclave of eighty Arahants 
                (highest Buddhist Sages). Among them were Deepankara Buddha, Kassyapa Gautama Buddha, and so on.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                This sanctified event had been spectacularly modeled out in clay plaster and lime in the form of statues 
                in glittering decor, while the murals are fascinatingly adorned with the lively episodes of Jataka Stories depicting the life 
                and times of the Bodisatta and then the Buddha.

                Hence it has been fittingly named Suvisi Vivarana Vihara Mandiraya. It comprises the replicas of Suvisi – (24) Buddha statues, 
                together with 80 other statues that are consecrated under one roof, are considered to be the only such models found not only in Sri Lanka but in the world.


                It was really a marvelous piece of work that took over two years to complete. This epic Vihara Mandira was unveiled by the former 
                President late J. R. Jayewardene on June 25, 1986.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The foundation stone laying ceremony for yet another massive building namely the Dharmamandira took place on 15.1.1987, and it was 
                inaugurated on 21.4.1990 by the former late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

                This Vihara was posthumously named after the late Venerable Thudawe Thera, the Guru of Venerable Girimale Chandraloka Thera.
