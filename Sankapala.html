                        Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya stands majestically on a rocky mountain as ample evidence to prove that this temple has been blessed by the saintly
                        monks who spent their time in peaceful meditation. Situated in the Ratnapura district belonging to the Atakalan Korale Thambagamu Pattu Pallebedda
                        Village the Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya lies on the outskirts of Ratnapura – Hambantota main road near the 24th milepost. From here a distance of
                        about 150 yards, is the rock mountain wherein the ruins of buildings, a Bo tree, a dagoba, and a cave Deralaya have been found.
                        Brahamin inscriptions cared beneath the drip ledges (“Katarama” in Sinhalese) of the rock dating back to a period even before the birth of Christ is ample evidence
                        to prove the existence of a monastery.

                Folklore has it that Pussadeva a warrior of King Dutu Gemunu (161-131 BC) resided here. This is confirmed by the fact that Pussadeva’s name has been mentioned in the rock inscriptions.
                Pussadeva who played a prominent part in King Dutugemunu’s wars was well-versed in the art of war and blowing the conch shell. Hence the emblem conch shell was used to identify him.
                Further, it is mentioned that later on in life he was ordained a monk and achieved the state of Rahath. However, owing to the evils of nature, this abode had been later abandoned.
                This place was resurrected again and made a popular place of worship by Venerable Karathota Dharmarama during the Kandyan period. It is learnt that King Rajadhi Rajasingha
                gifted Venerable Dharmarama the the village of Pallebedda for his good deeds. Situated in the Ratnapura District belonging to the Atakalan Korale Thambagamu Pattu Pallebedda Village
                the Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya lies on the outskirts of Ratnapura – Hambantota main road near the 24th milepost. From here a distance of about 150 yards, is the rock mountain
                wherein the ruins of buildings, a Bo tree, a dagoba, and a cave Deralaya have been found.

            <p align="justify">
                One outstanding feature of literary revelation is the famed Ven. Karatota Dhammananda. He was imprisoned by the king of Kandy Rajaddhi Rajasinghe of the 18th century as the
                king suspected the priest to be in close contact with the Dutch. He was arrested on the king’s order and imprisoned in Kandy.

                While in prison he wrote a book in verse form named ‘Bharasa Kavya Gharbha Chakraya‘ which was presented to the King through Aththaragama Rajaguru Bandara. This book was
                sent to all the Pandit scholars in Senkadagala. However, nobody was able to comprehend it. Thus the King ordered all eminent scholars to be present at a King’s
                Audience/Royal gathering (“Raja Sabawa”) in order to discuss and understand the contents of the book. When this was done the King was highly pleased and he bestowed
                Sri Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya and the village of Pallebedda amidst all pomp and glory to Venerable Karatota Dharmarama. This was a gift to appreciate the literary
                works of this Venerable monk. Even to date, this verse form could be seen drawn on the door to the entrance of the Viharaya. Among the other items gifted is the Disa
                Flag with the lion inscription, “Vatapatha” (A round-shaped fan used by monks), and a golden statue of Buddha. These could be seen safely guarded in the Viharaya
                along with the “Sannasa” (message written on an ola leaf) and epigraphy. Moreover, he was honoured by bestowing on him as the chief incumbent of Sri Padaya and low
                country Sangha Nayaka Status. The glory of the temple began with this incident and it prospered thereafter until now.

            <h5><u>Archaeological Findings</u></h5>

            <p align="justify">
                It is very important to note here the recent observation of the excavations conducted by the archaeological Department regarding Sri Sakhapala Rajamaha Viharaya and
                its surroundings. Steps have been taken to submit a report on its findings regarding the 14 caves scattered around the Rajamaha Viharaya. These caves have been numbered
                to make it easy for purposes of explanation.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: I</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                The length and breadth of this cave are 40ft and 25ft respectively. The height is 19 ft. This is situated on the eastern side of the Viharaya. Brahamin Scriptures
                engraved on the right side of the cave beneath the small drains carved to drain rainwater away from the Scriptures (known as Kataram) are clearly visible up to date.
                A small enclosure has been put up inside the cave recently.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: II</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave faces the Southeastern side of the rock. It is 40 ft long, 40 ft wide and 20 ft in height. Inside the rock cave, a small enclosure has been built with a wall and
                cladding with tiles. There is evidence to say that Kataram on this rock cave has been plastered with cement at a later point in time.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: III</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave facing the east of the rock is 20 ft long, 20 ft wide has a height of 10 ft. There is no trace of a Kataram or Scriptures. This cave occupies a Devalaya devoted
                to God Kataragama.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: IV</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This rock cave faces the west. The exposure of this rock to the fury of monsoonal and inter-monsoonal rains causing damage to the rock could be seen by the cleavage of the
                rock to some degree. This may possibly be due to the long length of the cave which is 78 ft and 34 ft wide with a height of 18 ft. Brahamin Scriptures have been engraved
                beneath the small Repledges (Katarama). Inside this cave is the Load Buddha’s Image House (“Budhu Madura” in Sinhalese). This cave has been transformed into two caves by
                building a wall separating it into two caves from where the rock has been cleft. Inside the image house is a reclining Buddha Statue. Just below the Repledge (Katarama)
                of the rock picture of a Dhagaba has been engraved.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: V</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                Towards the eastern side of the rock facing Southeast lies this cave. It is 62 ft in length, 18ft wide, and 30 ft in height. Small Repledges (Katarama) are clearly visible.
                An image house has been erected but there are no visible scripts.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: VI</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave faces the South and is situated towards the eastern side of the rock. It is 58 ft in length, 19 ft wide, and 20 ft high. A small enclosure has been put up for
                meditation. No inscriptions are visible.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: VII</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave too is situated towards the eastern side of the rock facing southeast. It is 14 ft long and 14 ft wide while the height is 17 ft. No inscriptions have been found.
            </p>

            <h6>Cave No: VIII</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave too is situated towards the eastern side of the rock. It is 24 ft long and 13 ft wide. The height is 12 ft. No inscriptions have been found, although two Repledges
                (Katarama) have been cut. A small enclosure for meditation has been constructed.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: IX</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave is situated towards the Southeastern side of the rock. No inscriptions are visible. It is 31 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 9 ft in height.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: X</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This again is facing the Northeast and is situated on the Western side of the rock. It is 9 ft in height. There is no trace of any inscriptions or
                (Katarama) Repledges
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: XI</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                The tombstone of the warrior Pussadeva can be seen at the bottom of the rock. This cave is situated facing the Western side of the tomb. It is 45 ft long, 19 ft wide and 20 ft
                in height. Although there are small Repledges (Katarama) along the rock, no inscriptions are visible.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: XII</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave is situated behind the present monastery beneath the rock. While it is 25 ft long, 12 ft wide, and 13 ft in height it has drains carved but no visible signs of inscriptions.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: XIII</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                This cave faces Northeast and is also situated behind the present monastery. Here too no inscriptions are found.
            </p>
            <h6>Cave No: XIV</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                No inscriptions nor Repledges (Katarama) are found. The length is 25 ft, width 19 ft, and height 8 ft.
            </p>
            <h6>Brahamin Cave</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                Close to the tombstone of Pussadeva is a huge cavity through a rock. This cavity is 12 ft long, 7 ft 8 inches wide and 10 ft in height. There is evidence to prove that this has been an abode of primitive men.
                People of the area call it ‘Thapas Guhawa’ meaning ‘where Bhramins lives’.
            </p>
            <h6>Tombstone of Pussa Deva</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                Traveling about three-quarters of a mile from Sri Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya towards Pallebedda one would come across that rock where ruins are present. The people of the village believe that this is the place where
                Pussadeva has been cremated.

                Here lie the ruins of a small Dagoba. It has been constructed on a square platform of which one side measures 34 ft. It is a round Stupa with a circumference of 60 ft. Although there are no other ruins to be seen here
                the archaeological value of this place cannot be undermined
            </p>
            <h5><u>Relics in the museum of Sri Sankapala Rajamaha Viharaya</u></h5>
            <h6>The Lion Flag</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                Among several other deeds gifted by King Rajadhi Rajasinghe to Venerable Karathota Dhammarama is a lion flag. It is a ‘disa’ flag (Meaning a flag for a particular district) wherein the sun and moon too have been drawn.
            </p>
            <h6>Vatapotha(A round-shaped fan used by monks)</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                A Vatapotha with a handle made of ivory and adorned with a fine piece of cut has been offered by King Rajadhi Rajasingha. This is covered with a red satin cloth.
            </p>
            <h6>Gold Buddha Statue</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                An eight-inch standing gold statue of Lord Buddha which has the characteristics of the Kandyan period has been donated by the King. There is yet another Buddha statue made of ivory preserved in the Museum.
            </p>
            <h6>Ola-leaf Manuscripts</h6>
            <p align="justify">
                A cover made of ivory, finely sculptured with a flowery design for an ola-leaf manuscript is a rare museum article and is safely preserved. In return for the two verses expressing gratitude to the King for the gifts donated, he
                has presented a feathery gold pen with a gold nib.
            </p>
            <h6>The deed of Pallebedda Sankhapala Viharaya</h6>
            <p align="justify">
